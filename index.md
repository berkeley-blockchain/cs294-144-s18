## Course description
Blockchain is one of the most significant technologies to impact law and business in many years. This course will provide an overview of the technology and code behind blockchain and explore current and potential real-world applications in technology, business, and law. 

## Class format and project
This is a lecture, discussion, and project oriented class. Each lecture will focus on one of the topics, including a survey of the state-of-the-art in the area and an in-depth discussion of the topic. Each week, students are expected to complete reading assignments before class and participate actively in class discussion.

Students will also form project groups (6 people per group: 2 from EECS, 2 from Haas, 2 from Boalt) and complete a high-impact class project. The final project/deliverable will be small team presentation on a new application of blockchain (with a legal and business analysis). 

## Enrollment information
